# HighFpsPhysicsPlugin
Simple plugin that cuts the physics refresh rate in half, making physics (kinda) work at high fps. 

Use /physics to enable/disable.

On boot it will be off just in case enabling it causes crashes for someone (or in case of patch), in order to prevent instantly crashing on boot.
